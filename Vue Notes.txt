1 - 
Vue Js - 
Framework
Light Weight 
High Performance
Open Source 
Initial Release - Feb, 2014
Can be used with or without NPM
Vue CLI is command line tool for Vue - used for dev and build process.

2 - 
Create a Vue Js project using the CLI - Vue create projectname

3 - 
File and Folder Structure - Done

4 - 
Passing Props to Components - Done

5 - 
Events and event handling - using v-on for Event Handling such as Click or Hover - Done

6 - 
Directives are instruction for VueJS to do things in a certain way. We have already seen directives such as v-if, v-show, v-else, v-for, v-bind , v-model, v-on, etc.
Condition rendering with data object

7 - 
There is no difference between vue-on:click="()=>doSomething()" and @click="()=>doSomething()"
@ is a shorthand for vue-on
For rendering list of item we use .map in React, here we use v-for directive

8 - 
Composition with components - Components Reusability and architecture same as in React

9 - Template's in Vue Js
State variable will be defined in data 
v-once will be processing the change only ones 
We can use multiple directives in a single component 

10 - Classes and Style binding
All examples are in StyleAndClassComponent Component

11 - Data Binding (Important) - Whenever data is changed, it is reflected automatically by the elements bound to the data. 
v-model is a directive that creates a two-way data binding between a value in our template and a value in our data properties. 

12 - Props
v-bind is also used to pass the property define inside the data function as a props
Props in Vue in similar to React with some mino  r difference
examples are there in PropsComponentFirst and Second one

13 - Child to Parents Props
Somewhat similar to react (uses a callback)

14 - Life cycle Methods (Hooks) - Important
We don't need to call the lifecycle methods for example created will automatically be called when a component is created 

Vue Lifecycle Methods -
1. beforeCreate
2. Created
3. beforeMount 
4. Mount 
5. beforeUpdate
6. Update 
7. beforeDestroy 
8. Destroy - Removed from DOM

15 - Basic Form Development - Checkboxes and Radio - using v-model 

16 - Basic Form Development - Getting input field data using onClick handler

17 - Basic Form Development - Validation - Basic Js Validation

18 - Filters in Vue js -  It is defined globally. 
Pipe operator is involved in using the filter
Define it in main.js file and then use this utitlity function in any component
Example in UsingFilterComponentExample.vue Component

19 - Lifecycle Method - beforeCreate and created in Vue Js
As the name suggest beforeCreate is called before the component is created 
created is called after the component is created - Data binding stuff happens inside created

20 - Lifecycle Method -  beforeMount and Mounted in Vue Js
beforeMount is called just before the component is about to render / before the component HTML is about to render 
Mount is called just after the component is rendered
this.$el = represents the HTML of the component
In beforeMount you won't be accessing any HTML Element  

21 - Lifecycle Method - beforeDestroy and Destroy in Vue Js
beforeDestroy is called just before a component is about to be removed from the DOM or UI
Destroy is called just after the component is removed from the DOM or UI 

22 - Fetching and using data from the API | Axios
Package - axios and vue-axios are widely used for this purpose

23 - Vue bootstrap - https://bootstrap-vue.org/ - Superb for Styling with Vue Js
Install Vue bootstrap - 
1. Vue CLI - vue add bootstrap-vue - Setup is already done by Vue CLI - In case of error Try without allowing permission for SCSS/SASS
2. npm js - npm install bootstrap-vue - Setup is not done - Manual setup might needs to be done

24 - Post API with form data

25 - Deleting a record / data with API

26 - Basic Routing Implementation 
Package used - vue-router
Step - 
create router index file with all the routes and then use it in main.js file.
router-view html tag now should be used in the App.js file template 
There is some versioning issue with Vue Router - Vue 2 is compatible with vue-router - 3.5.4 version
Complete Implementation - NavLinkComponent use here 

27 - Vue Routing Implementation - Continue 

28 - Vue Routing - Passing data in Routing params - easy check video for Implementation

29 - 404 Page not found Implementation using Vue Router - Simple use of * in routes array 
Always place the * path object at the end of the array 
 
30 - Dynamic Components
Component rendering on specific event based is the concept of Dynamic Component
Most useful when render component based on a Condition
Complete Implementation in DynamicComponent.vue 


Watcher - Watch the value of the property and with the defined function inside watch you can perform action onchange

27 - Computed Properties in Vue Js
Same as Data or methods but is used for complex operations - It have better performance and efficiency - It internally uses caching
